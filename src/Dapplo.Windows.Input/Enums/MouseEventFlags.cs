///     A set of bit flags that specify various aspects of mouse motion and button clicks.
///     The bits in this member can be any reasonable combination of the following values.
///     The bit flags that specify mouse button status are set to indicate changes in status, not ongoing conditions.
///     For example, if the left mouse button is pressed and held down,
///     MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN is set when the left button is first pressed, but not for subsequent motions.
///     Similarly, MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP is set only when the button is first released.
///     You cannot specify both the MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL flag and either MOUSEEVENTF_XDOWN or MOUSEEVENTF_XUP flags
///     simultaneously
///     in the dwFlags parameter, because they both require use of the mouseData field.
