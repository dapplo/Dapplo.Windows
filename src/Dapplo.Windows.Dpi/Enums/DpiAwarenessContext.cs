    ///     Per Monitor v2 was made available in the Creators Update of Windows 10, and is not available on earlier versions of the operating system.
    ///     The additional behaviors introduced are as follows:
    ///     * Child window DPI change notifications - In Per Monitor v2 contexts, the entire window tree is notified of any DPI changes that occur.
    ///     * Scaling of non-client area - All windows will automatically have their non-client area drawn in a DPI sensitive fashion. Calls to EnableNonClientDpiScaling are unnecessary.
    ///     * Scaling of Win32 menus - All NTUSER menus created in Per Monitor v2 contexts will be scaling in a per-monitor fashion.
    ///     * Dialog Scaling - Win32 dialogs created in Per Monitor v2 contexts will automatically respond to DPI changes.
    ///     * Improved scaling of comctl32 controls - Various comctl32 controls have improved DPI scaling behavior in Per Monitor v2 contexts.
    ///     * Improved theming behavior - UxTheme handles opened in the context of a Per Monitor v2 window will operate in terms of the DPI associated with that window.
